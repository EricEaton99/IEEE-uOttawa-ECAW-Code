#### Scenario: 
There was a manufacturing defect on the chip that was supposed to get the digital read from one of the buttons on the controller.
Now you must support 2 buttons using a single GPIO pin.
#### Task: 
Use 1 pin to detect both buttons using analogue read and resistors
#### Hardware: 
Combine the buttons in series, then add a resistor across the first button and a second resistor of a different resistance across the second button
