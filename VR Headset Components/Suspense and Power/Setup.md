### VR Headset Suspense and Power
#### Scenario
VRDreamerzzz.inc has commissioned you with developing the suspense module for their upcoming VR headset.
They want to improve the timing of jump-scares in the games their headset will support by giving devs data on the relative heart rate of a person.
I guess it could be used to enhance a serene setting as well, but that's boring.
They also need a power button for the headset.
#### Task
Retrieve heart rate input and transmit it with serial print.
Also, toggle the built-in LED with the button.
#### Hardware
- 1 Raspberry Pi Pico
- 1 micro USB-A cable
- 1 small breadboard
- 1 MAX30102 (Heart rate and Blood Oxygen)
- 1 tactile button
