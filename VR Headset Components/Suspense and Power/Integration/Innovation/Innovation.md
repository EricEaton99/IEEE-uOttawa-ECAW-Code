#### Scenario: 
Game devs have requested that instead of constantly sending the beats per minute, we only send messages when the heart rate has notably changed in frequency
#### Task: 
Remove the constant beats per minute and replace it with a signal that is sent when the BPM changes by more than 3. Also, add a flag for when the heart rate is high.
