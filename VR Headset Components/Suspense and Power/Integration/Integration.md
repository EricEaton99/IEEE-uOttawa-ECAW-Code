#### Scenario: 
The radiator in the headset was too small. To free up the room so we can increase its size, we need to merge the suspense and headset tracking modules.
#### Task: 
Find a group that is working on a headset tracking module and combine your projects so that they run off of the same microcontroller (use their breadboard since it has 5v power).
